# SKIP!!!!!!

Our focus for Term 3 is gaining a clearer vision of where you'd like to work.

Your company fit will come from a combination of 1) your current skill level 2) your company interests and 3) your "must-haves" in a role.

To do that we first need to get a sense of your current skill level.

Let's fill out two rubrics to do so.


# Job Readiness Rubric
Our internship readiness rubric should look familiar.

Again, this rubric gauges your readiness to pursue different level of jobs: paid internship, unpaid internship, full time work, or if you should level up your skills before pursuing a professional engineer role.

How did we come up with this rubric? The rubric is the combined wisdom of our staff of ~10 professional engineers with a collective 50+ years of coding experience. It is also based on our observation of 100+ alumni who have gotten jobs, as well as feedback from our two dozen industry partners. The rubric is well informed.

Please take a moment to fill it out again. We'll fill this out every term so you can see your progress.

# Company Fit rubric
Our next rubric will help you determine which *types of companies* are a "reach" "match" or "fallback".

What does that mean?!

Here's an analogy. When students apply to college, counselors typically advise them to apply to "reach" "match" and "fallback" schools. Reach schools are above their competency level. Match schools are at their competency level. Fallback schools are slightly below.

As you fill out this rubric, note which level of technical achievements match your own. This column is your match company size. The column to the right of your match companies is your "reach" company size. The column to the left of your match are your fallback companies. Use these outcomes to set expectations around your job search.

## Some things to note
- No category of company is "better" than another. They each have their benefits and drawbacks, as you'll see on the second page of the rubric.
- The rubric is an educated guess to your fit. It's purpose is to inform your search and communicate your likelihood of getting different roles. Use it for that purpose.

# Where do we go from here?

Now that we know our skill level and company fit, it's time to ask - what do I want in my first job out of Make School?
